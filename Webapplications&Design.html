<h1>Web applications and Design</h1>
<hr>
<p>By using HTML, you can create your own site. HTML is a form of computer coding that controls how web pages are built. Its code includes specific tags, which represent commands written in a language like English that describes how a web page should look. It is a brief version of the actual CSS that follows web language. It would enable developers to develop the website itself while ensuring it is compatible with all sorts of browsers. XHTML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is client-side software, and it uses HTML to make the design user-friendly.</p>
